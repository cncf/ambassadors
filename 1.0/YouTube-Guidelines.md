# Ambassador / Meetup YouTube Channel Guidelines #

CNCF has created a branded sister YouTube channel for [CNCF Ambassador and Meetu](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsCuH5QK0y4FT-DNayK1rIQ) use titled CNCF Ambassador and Meetups. Ambassadors and Meetups can use this channel to upload video recordings of their community meetings.

## Code of Conduct ##

All CNCF communications adhere to the [CNCF Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md) and that includes this channel.

## Admins ##

CNCF Staff are the channel owners. They can designate other community members as owners, managers, or communication manager. Email info@cncf.io to request a user role to the YouTube channel.

## Playlists ##
The CNCF Ambassador and Meetups channel has separate playlists for Ambassadors as a whole and each Meetup separately.

To better serve the community, [collaboration](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6109639) has been enabled to share the management of the playlists. Anyone with the appropriate link to the particular playlist can add videos to that particular playlist (links & playlists are one-to-one).

One of the admins will need to create your playlist for you.  When creating a playlist for a Meetup, they use the format: "<location> Meetup", unless your meetup has an established "brand", in which case they will use "<name> meetup".

## Adding Videos to the Ambassadors Channel ##

There are two ways to add videos to the Ambassadors channel.  

If your meetup already has its own Youtube channel, the best method is Playlist Collaboration.  This is where you upload the video to your channel, but then share the video to the appropriate playlist on the Ambassadors channel.

If you do not already have your own channel, then you can upload to the Ambassadors video channel directly.  You will require manager access to do this, so please ask for it.

## Uploading Guidelines for Collaborators ##

Only content related to Ambassador or Meetup meetings can be uploaded to the YouTube channel. Content should be uploaded to the appropriate playlist.

Do not remove any already-published content from the playlists without checking with the CNCF YouTube admins.

By default, new videos are set with the following settings:
* Standard Youtube License
* Public video
* Embedding allowed
* Comments disabled
* English language

You may change these settings on individual videos if you like, except for comments; please do not enable them as the CNCF staff are not prepared to police them.  Language should be changed to match the spoken language of the video. 

Please add a descriptive title, description, and date recorded for each video.
