# Campus Ambassador Toolkit for Students
Campus Ambassador Toolkit is a toolkit to get involved seniors students into the CNCF ecosystem in the way that they can gain experience using cloud native technologies for their future jobs, to develop new contributors and a way to get involved universities to contribute across research, thesis or open source contribution, etc.
  
## Objectives
Develop skills in the students to contribute to CNCF projects and create a space for students and universities in the CNCF ecosystem.

## The Programme
The College students(primarily engineering students) have the task of working on issues, research or thesis related to a CNCF Project. The CNCF Mentor here plays a vital role in helping the students work on topics of their interest related to these tasks, developing in that way their skills for the industry or to participate in a GSoC.  
  
The universities have assigned a project to do research about a topic related to Cloud Native Technologies in special new software or ideas that currently involve CNCF Projects. CNCF ambassador helps the university or students to lead the research.  
  
The programme should not be only on coding. Could be speakers or social media contributors in the same way like the CNCF Ambassador Program https://github.com/cncf/ambassadors.
  
## Advantages
- Helps CNCF in attracting college students to contribute to their projects.
- Helps CNCF in attracting college students to use cloud native technologies.
- Helps CNCF projects to test new features to speed their release and testing times.
- Involve Students in programs like Community Bridge or Google Summer of Code to contribute with CNCF projects.
- Open a space for students to get jobs related to cloud native technologies.
- Create a space for Universities contribution by doing research with their students using CNCF projects.
- Create a space for innovation and new ideas where universities, students and CNCF can get involved.
- Promote diversity and inclusion in the way that universities and students in other countries can contribute.
  
## To be done
- List CNCF projects that could be interesting in this student kit.
- Define the minimum skills to develop in potential students contributors
- Define the steps to get involved students into participate into GSoC related to CNCF projects
- List professor, universities that can be interested in this program.
- Generate a vault of projects, features of issues that the students/students can be involved in.
- Assigning the students to the respective mentors based on the projects.
- Define deadlines for testing ideas, issues related to GSoC
- Periodic evaluation of students on the progress of the projects by the mentors.
- A Certificate and a small token of appreciation on successful completion of the project.
- Ambassadors to publicise the mentors programme and help students with a smooth entry in the project.
- If possible create a CNCF conference for students to promote students participation
- Gather students opinions about this kind of opportunities to enrich this student kit
- Work together with universities to update their syllabus in the way to include cloud native theory in their courses.
- Provide courses or small guides to create a quickstart to contribute to CNCF projects.
  
## Conducting CNCF Webinars and conferences in Colleges
As part of the mentor programme, conducting CNCF webinars and conferences in college helps CNCF in attracting more students and there-by increasing the user base and also creating an awareness of what CNCF projects are and its benefits.
