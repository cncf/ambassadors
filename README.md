### FAQ

#### How often are ambassador applications reviewed?

We review hundreds of applications each month, but can only accept a few new CNCF Ambassadors from the pool of highly-qualified individuals. 
We are currently prioritizing Ambassadors who organize Meetups around CNCF technologies in regions not already represented.

#### Do I need to re-apply?

No, once you formally apply you are part of the pool of applicants that get reviewed on a monthly basis.

#### Will you email me with a status update of my application each month?

No. We will only follow up if your application is accepted.

#### I'd like to get in touch with the CNCF ambassador in a specific city/region. Where can I find who is a local ambassador?

Here is [a map of the CNCF Ambassadors](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1fb0UPi8ijeexueBxcpGuvVlZ_8hJHXVQ&usp=sharing).

NOTE: If you are an existing CNCF Ambassador and would like to adjust your location on the map, please contact the CNCF Staff.

#### What if I want to step down or don't have the time to commit anymore? 

We have an [Emeritus](EMERITUS.md) program to address Ambassadors who'd like to step down from active engagement but still be invited to participate in calls and the community. If you decide to become more active again, emeritus ambassadors are always welcome to be reinstated as full CNCF Ambassadors. Please open up an issue in the repo to start the process.
