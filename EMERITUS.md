# Ambassador Emeritus

For those who need to step down from a more active commitment to the CNCF Ambassador community. We thank all of our previous ambassadors for their commitment to the community and all the good work they have done.

## Benefits:

You'll still be listed as an ambassador emeritus on the CNCF page and are entitled to attend Ambassador meetings, and remain in the current communication channels. However, you won't be able to claim any fiscal benefits provided part of the program.
