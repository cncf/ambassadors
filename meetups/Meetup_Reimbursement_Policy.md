**CNCF Ambassadors can be reimbursed for up to $150 per month for Meetup-related expenses, including food, beverages, and swag from the online store. Exceptions for higher amounts or special items are granted on a case-by-case basis (see below).**

Reimbursement Instructions:

-	Please submit one invoice for any related expenses within a calendar month.
	-	No rounding.
	-	The totals should be in USD.
	-	We require receipts for your expenses.
-	If you don’t already have expense report software, we recommend creating a free, single-person account in Expensify. You can then either forward your receipts by email to receipts@expensify.com or install the app and take pictures of your receipts (or both).
	-	Please title the expense report in this format: Full Name - Description - Date (e.g., Clark Kent - Cloud Native Metropolis Meetup - 11/08/18)
	-	Please include your banking/wire details as a comment or an attached document in your expense report.  Please do not send banking/wire details in the body of an email.
	-	Expensify converts from any currency to dollars.
	-	Each expense should include a comment (e.g., stickers from CNCF online store, pizza for August Meetup).
-	Please do *not* use the electronic submit feature from Expensify or similar. Instead, just download a PDF and email it. The email also gives you a receipt of your submission.
-	Please expense receipts after you have spent the money.
-	Email the expense report (which includes the receipts) to ambassador-support@cncf.io.
	-	For Meetup food/beverage reimbursements, please include a link to that month’s Meetup page in your email.
	-	If you are based in the US, please provide your mailing address or ACH info in the email.
	-	If you are not based in the US, please include your wire info in the email.
-	We try to reimburse you in less than 2 weeks.

**Exceptions**

In some cases, you may need to spend in excess of $150 in one month on your meetup for CNCF-supported purposes, such as purchasing swag for a year, staffing a booth at a public conference, or hosting a special event for the broader CNCF community. For such expenses, please:

1.	Email ambassador-support@cncf.io with a request for pre-approval of the expense well in advance of spending it.
2.	Include information about the expected expense and an estimate of cost, and a justification as to why this supports CNCF’s mission.
3.	Wait for approval before spending the funds.
4.	If the funds are approved, submit an expense report using the above expense process.
