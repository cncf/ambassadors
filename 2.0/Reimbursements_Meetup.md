Exceptions for higher amounts or special items are granted on a case-by-case basis (see below).**

#### **What Can You Expense**
-	Food & Beverage
-	Venue
-	Swag
-	Equipment specific for meetup
-	Transportation (taxi, parking, etc.)
-	You can combine monthly reimbursements, such as if you host on a quarterly basis and haven't submitted an expense for January or February and the event is in March. You can submit up to $450 USD in this case. We will not allow a meetup to exceed 3 months of combined reimbursements.

#### **Exceptions**

In some cases, you may need to spend in excess of $150 in one month or $450 for three months on your meetup for CNCF-supported purposes, such as purchasing swag for a year, staffing a booth at a public conference, or hosting a special event for the broader CNCF community. For such expenses, please:

1.	Email ambassador-support@cncf.io with a request for pre-approval of the expense well in advance of spending it.
2.	Include information about the expected expense and an estimate of cost, and a justification as to why this supports CNCF’s mission.
3.	Wait for approval before spending the funds.
4.	If the funds are approved, submit an expense report using the above expense process.



We try to reimburse you in less than 2 weeks. If you have any questions, please reach out to ambassador-support@cncf.io.
